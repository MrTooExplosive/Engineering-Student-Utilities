# Engineering-Student-Utilities
This repository is a personal project. Written in C++ using Win32, the application will help combine all the information I've learned in one place and help solve simple problems from a wide variety of topics.

I am also learning the integration of Git with Visual Studio through this project so there are many extra files. If someone is looking for the code I have wrote, the current file is "Engineering-Student-Utilities/Engineering Utilities/Engineering Utilities.cpp"
Any other files are automatically generated by Visual Studio.
